ASP.NET Performance Tests
=========================

Performance tests and infrastructure for ASP.NET.

This project is part of ASP.NET 5. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET 5 at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

In order to execute the tests, first ensure that the peformance dashboard database has been created in your system by running the PerformanceDashboard web project. Once the database is generated then we can run the performance tests and see the results logged.

The tests can be run by executing .\build.cmd from the project root.
